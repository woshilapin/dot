tmux configuration
==================

# Initialization
To initialize and install all the plugins in `tmux`, run `tmux` and inside
`tmux`, hit `<prefix>+I` to install all plugins (*this might take a few
minutes without any UI feedback*), then `<prefix>+r` to reload configuration
file (which will then find the plugins).
