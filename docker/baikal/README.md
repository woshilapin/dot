# Configuration
When first launched, Baikal will ask for configuration.  This Docker Compose
setup is configured to use MySQL (MariaDB implementation).  Here are the
credentials to configure to it.

```
MySQL host         : mariadb
MySQL database name: baikal
MySQL username     : baikal
MySQL password     : baikal
```
