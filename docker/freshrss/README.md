# Configuration
When first launched, FreshRSS will ask for configuration.  This Docker Compose
setup is configured to use PostgreSQL.  Here are the credentials to configure to
it.

```
PostgreSQL host         : postgres
PostgreSQL database name: freshrss
PostgreSQL username     : freshrss
PostgreSQL password     : freshrss
```
